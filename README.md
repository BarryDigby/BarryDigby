### Bio
- BSc Biotechnology (NUIG 2011-2015)
- MSc Biomedical Genomics (NUIG 2017-2018)
- PhD in Genomic Data Science (NUIG 2019-Present)

Currently a member of Dr. Pilib Ã’ Broin's lab at National University of Ireland, Galway. 

Research interests currently include clinical data analysis, development of reproducible bioinformatics pipelines via Docker/Singularity containerisation and nextflow scripting. Extracurricular interests include developing and delivering workshops on NGS data analysis.

### Research Project 
My thesis project is centered around the investigation of circularRNAs in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Due to their stability and tissue specific expression, circRNAs are a promising candidate as a clinical biomarker which can be used to stratify patients response to enzalutamide - an anti-androgen used for the treatment of CRPC. Furthermore, circRNAs can help elucidate the mechanism of enzalutamide resistance (which affects ~30% patients) by investigating their role as miRNA sponges in the competing endogenous RNA network.

To aid these research goals, I have developed a circRNA analysis pipeline in nextflow capable of consolidating results from multiple circRNA quantification tools maximising the circRNA profile in samples, predict circRNA - miRNA targets & perform circRNA differential expression analysis between the phenotype of interest.

The workflow can be used as a core production pipeline for sequencing facilities or as a standalone pipeline for research labs to fully elucidate the role of circRNAs in cancer genomics, aiding clinical decisions in health care.
