#### Bio
BSc Biotechnology, MSc Biomedical Genomics & currently PhD in Genomic Data Science at National University of Ireland, Galway with the Ã“ Broin Lab. 

Research interests currently include clinical data analysis, development of reproducible bioinformatics pipelines via Docker/Singularity containerisation and nextflow scripting.

#### Research Project 
My thesis project is centered around the investigation of circularRNAs in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Due to their stability and tissue specific expression, circRNAs are a promising candidate as a clinical biomarker which can be used to stratify patients response to enzalutamide - an anti-androgen used for the treatment of CRPC. Furthermore, circRNAs can help elucidate the mechanism of enzalutamide resistance (which affects ~30% patients) by investigating their role as miRNA sponges in the competing endogenous RNA network.

To this end, I have developed a circRNA analysis pipeline in nextflow capable of consolidating results from multiple circRNA quantification tools maximising the circRNA profile in samples, perform circRNA - miRNA target prediciton and perform circRNA differential expression analysis between the phenotype of interest.
